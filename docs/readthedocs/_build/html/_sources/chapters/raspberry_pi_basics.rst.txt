Raspberry Pi Tutorial
=======================

A small crash course on setting up and using the Raspberry Pi
(as a server, ftp storage, home-base, etc.)

What is a Raspberry Pi?
-----------------------
A Raspberry Pi is a credit card sized computer that can run Linux
(and other OS) to do almost anything your computer can do. It can
be simply connected to a monitor/TV, keyboard and mouse and be used
as a regular computer. Because of its low power consumption, it is
used as a web-server, file storage system, home automation system,
etc. It can also be connected to an Arduino to aid in robotics such
as the PiCar.
