PiCar Project
========================

The PiCar project is a miniature four-wheeled car powered by a Raspberry Pi 3 board. 
This lab-scale autonomous research platform is easy to build and modify. A camera and LIDAR mounted on the car allows for complex computer vision algorithms. 

This repository contains all the software and hardware source files required to duplicate the car, including:
* Chassis 3D printing, and CAD sources.
* Raspberry Pi 3 breakout PCB to connect peripherals and draw power from LiPo battery.
* Source code of the following sofware modules capable of:
 * Acquire wheel RPM data using encoder.
 * Acquire acceleration, angular velocity, and compass data from an IÂ²C LSM9DS1 IMU.
 * Acquire video data from a Raspberry Pi NoIR camera.
 * Perform real-time computer vision using camera data.
 * Control the speed of brushed DC motor.

Documentation for the above can be accessed via the project's wiki: https://github.com/xz-group/PiCar/wiki
